          <h5 class="mx-2">Different points to remember while designing Green building</h5>
          <p>1. Energy Efficiency: A green building should be designed to reduce its energy consumption and improve its overall energy efficiency. This can be achieved by incorporating passive design strategies such as orienting the building to maximize natural light and ventilation, using high-performance insulation, and incorporating energy-efficient windows and doors. Active design strategies such as using energy-efficient HVAC systems, lighting, and appliances can also help to reduce energy consumption.</p>
            
            <p>2. Water Efficiency: A green building should also be designed to conserve water. This can be achieved by using low-flow fixtures, such as toilets and faucets, and implementing rainwater harvesting systems that collect rainwater for non-potable uses such as landscaping and irrigation. Water-efficient landscaping practices such as using drought-tolerant plants and designing the landscape to retain stormwater can also help to reduce water consumption.</p>
            <p>3. Sustainable Materials: A green building should use sustainable and eco-friendly materials throughout its construction. This includes materials that are recycled, renewable, or locally sourced. Using materials with a low embodied energy, such as timber, bamboo, or recycled steel, can also help to reduce the environmental impact of the building.</p>
            <p>4. Indoor Environmental Quality: A green building should provide a healthy and comfortable indoor environment for its occupants. This can be achieved through the use of natural ventilation, air filtration systems that remove pollutants from the air, and the use of non-toxic building materials that do not emit harmful chemicals or off-gas.</p>
            <p>5. Waste Reduction: A green building should minimize waste generation and promote recycling. This can be achieved through the implementation of recycling programs, composting, and the use of recycled materials in construction. Designing for deconstruction and reuse can also help to minimize waste generation during the building's lifecycle.</p>
            <p>6. Site Sustainability: A green building should be designed to minimize its impact on the surrounding environment. This includes preserving natural habitats, reducing stormwater runoff by using permeable surfaces, and minimizing the use of resources during construction, such as water and energy. Designing a building with a smaller footprint can also help to reduce its impact on the site and surrounding environment.</p>
