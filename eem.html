          <h5 class="mx-2">Energy Efficient Materials Requirements in building</h5>
          <p>When it comes to building materials, there are a number of options that can help make buildings more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. For instance, Insulated Concrete Forms (ICFs) are blocks made from foam insulation that can be used to construct walls. Because they provide excellent insulation, they can help to reduce energy consumption and cut down on heating and cooling costs.
            
            <p>Another option is Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), which consist of foam insulation sandwiched between two layers of structural material. They also provide a high level of insulation and can help to reduce air infiltration, which in turn can help to lower energy bills.</p>
            <p>Low-E windows are a third option that can help to reduce energy consumption. These windows have a special coating that reflects infrared light, keeping heat inside during the winter and outside during the summer. This results in lower heating and cooling costs overall.</p>
            <p>Cool roofs are yet another way to make buildings more energy efficient. These roofs are designed to reflect sunlight and heat away from the building, which in turn helps to reduce the amount of heat that the building absorbs. Green roofs, which are covered in vegetation, can also help to reduce heat absorption and lower cooling costs. In addition, they provide insulation and can help to reduce stormwater runoff.</p>
            <p>Energy efficient lighting is another important consideration when it comes to making buildings more energy efficient. LED lighting is an excellent choice, as it uses far less energy than traditional lighting and can save significant amounts of money over time.</p>
            <p>Finally, renewable energy systems like solar panels and wind turbines can provide clean energy for buildings, helping to reduce energy consumption and lower energy costs. While the initial investment can be significant, these systems can pay off over time and provide a significant return on investment.</p>
